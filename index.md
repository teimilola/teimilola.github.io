## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

I am currently a mid-level software engineer working on Machine Learning Infra.

I have about 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer.  I worked on <a href="https://atscaleconference.com/videos/ai-scale-2020-f3-next-generation-feature-framework-at-facebook/"> Facebook's Feature Framework (F3), working on improving ML engineers' ability to innovate, build features and experiment faster.  </a>
  
I've worked on building ranking and retrieval models to help people discover communities, content and events as an ML Generalist on Facebook Search.
 
In another life, I built Android applications as part of internships.

I am broadly interested in building great ML Infrastructure and accelerating development times of the next big AI wins.


I also generally find advances in Natural Language Processing(specifically Commonsense reasoning, Natural Language generation and Narrative understanding)  interesting. I spend some time reading papers, updates in these areas because I think it's really exciting


Outside of software engineering, I enjoy watching netflix shows, reading, writing short stories and essays. It's Fall in Seattle currently, which means my favorite pasttime will be reading while watching rain fall out my window.
