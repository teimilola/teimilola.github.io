## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

I am currently a software engineer working on Search ranking and ML.

I am broadly interested in natural language processing and specifically in commonsense reasoning, Narrative Understanding, Natural language inference and generation and NLP for low-resource languages.

My past work has explored social media and the spread of health (mis)information.

Outside of software engineering, ML and NLP, I enjoy writing short stories and essays.
