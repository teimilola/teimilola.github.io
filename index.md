## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

I am currently a mid-level software engineer working on Machine Learning Infra.

I am originally from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬.

I have about 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer.  I've worked on <a href="https://atscaleconference.com/videos/ai-scale-2020-f3-next-generation-feature-framework-at-facebook/"> Facebook's Feature Framework (F3)</a>, working on improving ML engineers' ability to innovate, build features and experiment faster.  
  
I've worked on building ranking and retrieval models to help people discover communities, content and events as an ML Generalist on Facebook Search.
 
In another life, I built Android applications as part of internships.

I am broadly interested in building great ML Infrastructure and accelerating development times of the next big AI wins.

## Hobbies & Other Interests

I also generally find advances in Natural Language Processing(specifically Commonsense reasoning, Natural Language generation and Narrative understanding)  interesting. I spend some time reading papers, updates in these areas because I think it's really exciting.

Interested in ML Systems in general.


Outside of software engineering, I enjoy watching netflix shows, reading, writing short stories and essays.
